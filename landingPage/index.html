      Integrating enhanced meteorological Data for more accurate river flow
      Predictions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Floods wreak havoc by endangering lives and causing billions in damages.
      Effective flood forecasting can mitigate these dire consequences by
      providing timely warnings to safeguard lives and livelihoods. Accurately
      predicting river levels is a critical aspect of flood damage mitigation
      and preparation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA) already predicted river levels with a 16.47 percent average error
      rate. Our project partner developed an approach to predict river levels
      which achieved an error rate of 13.62 percent. Our teams tasks was to
      update the historical and current weather provider.Our software receives
      the historical and current weather data from the new weather model’s API,
      converts it to a custom object storing the relevant data and metadata, and
      then uploads it to AWS for mass storage to be used in the training and
      testing process. This data is then used to train the model at locations
      relevant to the river level, which are then combined to predict the future
      river level.

    <h2>Data Collection and Ensembling</h2>
    <img src="https://imgur.com/nYZaQda.png" alt="River Catchments" />
    <p>
      Each river has one level collection point and multiple surrounding weather
      collection points. Neural networks are trained at each weather point to
      learn the impact of rain, temperature, humidity, etc., on the river level.
      Each collection point is fed to another neural network to consolidate one
      prediction for the corresponding river. Our model requires both historical
      data and forecast data. Both of which are retrieved from the same provider
      - Open Meteo’s ECMWF Model - in roughly the same location. Both are stored
      along with historical river level directly retrieved from NOAA in Amazon
      Web Services for future ease of access. We're using DARTS with a
      transformer model for our neural network, leveraging the latest
      advancements to train faster, capture long-term patterns, and enhance
      accuracy.

    <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>
    <img src="https://imgur.com/CuqUgcM.png" alt="Data pipeline" />
    <p>
      We used a script to upload historical data of NOAA and Open-Meteo to an
      AWS s3 bucket. This includes daily information from 2017-2023. We used an
      AWS Lambda function to collect current data from Open-Meteo and NOAA
      predictions We used the OSU HPC to train a model based on the current and
      historical data from Open-Meteo and compare it against the forecasts made
      by NOAA
